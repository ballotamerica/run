          <h2 class="subtitle is-4 has-text-left has-text-weight-normal has-text-white">2016 and 2018 taught us that who the candidate is matters. How well they communicate online and in-person, how comfortable they are in their skin, and how "geniune" they can be are all important factors.

We’re willing to help good candidates wherever they are - regardless if they're in rural or urban centers.</h2>
